Sure, I'd be happy to help you write an application for leave. Here's an example:

[Your Name]
[Your Class/Section]
[School Name]
[Date]

Subject: Application for Leave

Respected Principal,

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to attend school on [date(s)] due to personal reasons. I regret any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that I will make up for any missed work upon my return.

I would appreciate it if you could grant me leave for this period. I have attached a medical certificate from my doctor as proof of my inability to attend school.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
